					Alvin and the Chipmunks, originally David Seville and the Chipmunks or simply The Chipmunks, is an American animated music group created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr., for a novelty record in 1958. The group consists of three singing animated anthropomorphic chipmunks: Alvin, the mischievous troublemaker, who quickly became the star of the group; Simon, the tall, bespectacled intellectual; and Theodore, the chubby, impressionable one

					</p>

					<p>
					The trio is managed by their human mentor, and later adoptive father, David (Dave) Seville. In reality, "David Seville" was Bagdasarian's stage name, and the Chipmunks themselves are named after the executives of their original record label. The characters became a success, and the singing Chipmunks and their manager were given life in several animated cartoon productions, using redrawn, anthropomorphic chipmunks, and eventually films.

					1. Justin Long, the voice of Alvin in the movie series, went hoarse frequently during filming since he had to do such a high pitch! 
					<br>2. The third Chipmunks movie, "Chipwrecked," is the most family-friendly of the bunch, earning a  rating while the others have been PG.
					<br>3. Alvin and the Chipmunks were originally created for a novelty record in 1958, and then appeared in comic book form the following year.   
					<br>4. Actual chipmunks are called bucks if they're boys and does if they're girls.
					<br>5. No real chipmunks were harmed -- or used -- during the making of the movies. And that's probably a good thing, because while they look cute, they should not be kept as pets. They need to be cared for by a specialist when not in the wild.

			<h2>First Appearance</h2>
			<p>

			The Chipmunks first appeared in comic book form on Dell's Four Color Comics series, issue #1042 (cover-dated Dec. 1959). Alvin, Theodore and Simon were depicted as somewhat realistic, nearly identical anthropomorphic rodents with almond-shaped eyes.

			<h2>Evolution</h2>
			<p>
			
			The first television series to feature the characters was The Alvin Show. The cartoon gave more distinctive looks and personalities to the three chipmunks than just their voices, and an animated portrayal of Seville was a reasonable caricature of Bagdasarian himself.
